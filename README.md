Welcome to Maverick
================
Maverick is a PHP web development framework I have been working on in my spare time, it is my hope that with this framework, I will be able to increase my rate of development, and so, increase my production.

You might find it odd, that with many other well established PHP frameworks already available, I would create my own. This is a valid point, and to it I will simply say, I do it because I like to. I simply do not see any fun, or creativity in downloading/cloning an existing framework, and using it.

The code you will find in this repository is what I consider to be a rough draft, it is not a final product. The development is ongoing, and if you would like to contribute, please feel free!
